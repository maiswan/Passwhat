![A screenshot of the Passwhat v1.3.0 main interface, showing a generated password under default configuration.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64370fb7-82a9-4271-a695-9b7f851b7010)

## What?

This is another password generator. It has a...
* customizable character set and length
* list of copied passwords so you don't lose them accidentally (cleared on exit of course)

## Why?

* [don't trust online password generators](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/17943)
* [don't reinvent the CSPRNG](https://www.cryptofails.com/post/72902772336/how-not-to-csprng)

The natural course of action is to roll my own solution and hopefully someone will audit it.
