![A screenshot of the Passwhat main interface, showing a generated password under default configuration.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854d3f13-146c-4b6b-8e5b-a9e9b43aff2a)

This is yet another password generator. It exists because

* [don't trust online password generators](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/17943)
* [don't reinvent the CSPRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator)

so the natural course of action is to roll my own solution and hopefully someone will audit it.
